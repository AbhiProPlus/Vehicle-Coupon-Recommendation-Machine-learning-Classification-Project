## **In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation System**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a person will accept a coupon during a drive based on various factors, such as weather conditions, time of day, passenger type, and more. The goal is to predict coupon acceptance in different driving scenarios, helping businesses offer personalized promotions.

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Feature Engineering & Selection
Model Training & Evaluation
Predictions on Unseen Data

##üìÇ**Dataset Details**

Link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/603/in+vehicle+coupon+recommendation

Dataset Name: In-Vehicle Coupon Dataset
Instances (Rows): 12,684
Features (Columns): 25 (includes both categorical and numerical features)
Target Variable: coupon_response (Values: 0 for not accepted, 1 for accepted)

üìä ## **Key Features**

Weather	: Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy)
Time of Day	Time during which the coupon offer is made
Temperature	Environmental temperature in Celsius
Passenger Type	: Type of passengers in the vehicle (e.g., family, solo)
Coupon Offer Type	: Type of coupon offered (e.g., discount, free item)
...	Additional features related to the driving scenario

üéØ ## **Project Objectives**

Understand the Dataset
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations between features.

Preprocess the Data
Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Perform feature selection to eliminate redundant features and enhance model accuracy.

Train and Evaluate Models
Experiment with different classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Predict Coupon Acceptance on Unseen Data
Test the trained model on a separate unseen dataset to predict coupon acceptance.

üõ†Ô∏è ## **Tools & Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
Feature Engineering: scipy

üèÜ ## **Key Results & Insights**

Model Performance:
Random Forest Classifier achieved a prediction accuracy of approximately 76% on the test set.

Feature Importance:
Features like weather, time of day, and passenger type were found to be the most influential in predicting coupon acceptance.

Prediction on Unseen Data:
Successfully predicted coupon acceptance on unseen data, with high confidence in predictions for various coupon types.


üî• ## **Future Improvements**

Model Optimization: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest model for better generalization.
Real-time Predictions: Implement a real-time system for in-vehicle coupon recommendation.
Additional Data Sources: Integrate more driving scenario data for enhanced prediction accuracy.

üìù ## **Conclusion**

This project successfully developed a machine learning model that can predict coupon acceptance based on real-time in-vehicle data. The use of preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques led to a reliable and accurate model. Future improvements can include real-time deployment and the integration of additional data sources.
